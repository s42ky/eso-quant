This addon contains a collection of tools for getting data from Elder Scrolls Online.
It's a combination of in-game addon modules, external scripts, and some HTML for viewing the data
afterwords.

# Warnings
This is not an easy setup. I've made it as easy as possible, but there are a lot of moving parts.
Furthermore, you still have to do a lot of the work afterwords.

This addon can use a lot of lua memory to export data. Consider disabling other addons when running.
As well, you'll want to delete/move the saved variables for this when you're done.

Also, your game may appear to freeze while doing some of the commands. This is normal.
A lot of the commands involve a lot of processing, and it's not really a priority to make the
game run smoothly during them.

Health data is not recorded yet. This will make some of the skill formulas wildly inaccurate.
Pay close attention to the R squared value.

# Installation
1) Install the addon in-game
  a) Install Wykkyd's Outfitter (required for some modules)
  b) Put into addon folder for game

2) Install R (http://www.r-project.org/)
  a) Install Rserve. Within the R cli, type the following command:
    `install.packages("Rserve")`
NOTE: Stand-alone Rserve can be used if desired for most functionality

3) Install Scilua / LuaJIT
  a) Follow the directions on http://www.scilua.org/get.html
  b) Make sure to get the main Xsys library and the Rclient library.

# Usage
## Addon in-game

There are several different modules in-game. They're accessesd by slash commands and self-documenting.
Type `/quant` in the chat box to see a list of commands and a brief description.

### Major modules:
* Champion system -- (`cs` and `cs-desc`) dumping champion system per-point data and descriptions
* Stats dump -- Exports character current character stats
* Skill dump -- Exports description and details about skills
* Skill curve -- Iterates through gear to record skill tooltip numbers at different stats*
* Sets dump -- Exports a dump of all set info
* Power register -- crude dumping of stamina/magicka changes to chatbox

## External Lua

Several commands write out to the game's `SavedVariables`. A few of the scripts are designed to extract
the data from the `SavedVariables` file and process it.

First you need to setup the `cfg.lua` in the root directory. If you don't, the scripts won't find your
saved variables.

To access, run the `runScripts.lua` file in the base directory. Files will be output in that same directory.
There's a brief summary, buts see the individual scripts for more details.

## HTML
I've started working on some HTML for displaying. After exporting the data to JSON, move the JSON into the
same folder as the HTML. You can then open the HTML in Firefox. 

Note: Unless you actually host it on a site (or some complicated workarounds), Chrome will not load local
files.

-----------------------------------------------------
# Cleanup
Delete `Quant.lua` from your SavedVariables directory when you are done with it

# Extension
In-game
* See `modules/Template.lua` for a documented example of the framework.
* After adding a module, include its path in `Quant.txt` at the end.

External
* There are several convenience functions in `scripts/inc` to help out
* Consider adding to the `runScript.lua` to make it easier to access
