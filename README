See LICENSE file for licensing information (GPLv2).
For now, I'd prefer a limited distribution, the GPL doesn't prohibit posting elsewhere.
I'll release myself eventually to ESOUI once it's cleaned up a bit more.

I don't feel it's suitably portable enough for a wide install. Although it is tempting
to try to hold this for limited DC use only, I'll release it... eventually.

-----------------------------------------------------
-- WARNINGS
-----------------------------------------------------
This addon uses a lot of lua memory to export data. Consider disabling other addons when running.
As well, you'll want to delete/move the saved variables for this when you're done.

Also, your game may appear to freeze while doing some of the commands. This is normal.
A lot of the commands involve a lot of processing, and it's not really a priority to make the
game run smoothly during them.

Health data is not recorded yet. This will make some of the skill formulas wildly inaccurate.
Pay close attention to the R squared value.

-----------------------------------------------------
-- INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------
1) Install the addon in-game
  a) Install Wykkyd's Outfitter (required for some modules)
  b) Put into addon folder for game

2) Install R (http://www.r-project.org/)
  a) Install Rserve. Within the R cli, type the following command:
    install.packages("Rserve")
NOTE: Stand-alone Rserve can be used if desired for most functionality

3) Install Scilua / LuaJIT
  a) Follow the directions on http://www.scilua.org/get.html
  b) Make sure to get the main Xsys library and the Rclient library.

-----------------------------------------------------
-- USAGE
-----------------------------------------------------
1) Addon in-game

There are several different modules in-game. They're accessesd by slash commands and self-documenting.
Type "/quant" in the chat box to see a list of commands and a brief description.

Major modules:
Champion system -- (cs and cs-desc) dumping champion system per-point data and descriptions
Stats dump -- Exports character current character stats
Skill dump -- Exports description and details about skills
Skill curve -- Iterates through gear to record skill tooltip numbers at different stats
Power register -- crude dumping of stamina/magicka changes to chatbox

2) External Lua

Several commands write out to the game's SavedVariables. A few of the scripts are designed to extract
the data from the SavedVariables file and process it. These scripts are located in the ./scripts/ folder.

NOTE: At this point you'll need to edit the stand-alone scripts to read from your account name within the
saved variables file.

Major scripts:
DumpForR.lua - outputs data for a particular skill. This is in a format suitable for R's read.csv command.
SkillFormulaDump.lua - outputs only skill formula coefficients with names.
SkillDataExtract.lua - main script for curve fitting and skill detail dump. Outputs as tab-delimited
SkillNamesByLine.lua - outputs a listing of skill names sorted by type and line

Most output is in a tab-delimited file, suitable for Excel import.
See the individual scripts for more details.

-----------------------------------------------------
-- CLEANUP

DELETE Quant.lua when you are done with it

-----------------------------------------------------
-- EXTENSION
-----------------------------------------------------
See modules/Template.lua for a documented example of the framework.
After adding a module, include its path in Quant.txt at the end.
